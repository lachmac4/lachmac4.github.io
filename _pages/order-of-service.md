<h4>How Great Thou Art</h4>
</div>
<div class=song>
O Lord my God when I in awesome wonder <br>
Consider all the works Thy hand hath made    <br>
I see the stars I hear the rolling thunder    <br>
Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed    <br>
<br>
<i>
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee    <br>
How great Thou art, how great Thou art    <br>
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee    <br>
How great Thou art, how great Thou art    <br>
</i>
<br>
When through the woods and forest glades I wander <br> 
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees  <br>
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur  <br>
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze  <br>
  
<br>
<i>
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee    <br>
How great Thou art, how great Thou art    <br>
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee    <br>
How great Thou art, how great Thou art    <br>
</i>
<br>
  
And when I think that God His Son not sparing  <br>
Sent Him to die I scarce can take it in  <br>
That on the Cross my burden gladly bearing  <br>
He bled and died to take away my sin <br>
  
<br>
<i>
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee    <br>
How great Thou art, how great Thou art    <br>
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee    <br>
How great Thou art, how great Thou art    <br>
</i>
<br>
  
When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation  <br>
And take me home what joy shall fill my heart  <br>
Then shall I bow in humble adoration  <br>
And there proclaim my God how great Thou art  <br>
  
<br>
<i>
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee    <br>
How great Thou art, how great Thou art    <br>
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee    <br>
How great Thou art, how great Thou art    <br>

<h3>BIBLE READINGS</h3>

<hr>
<h4>Psalm 34</h4>
</div>
<div class="song">

I will extol the Lord at all times;  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>his praise will always be on my lips.    <br>
I will glory in the Lord;  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>let the afflicted hear and rejoice.    <br>
Glorify the Lord with me;  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>let us exalt his name together.    <br>
    <br>
I sought the Lord, and he answered me;  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>he delivered me from all my fears.    <br>
Those who look to him are radiant;  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>their faces are never covered with shame.    <br>
This poor man called, and the Lord heard him;  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>he saved him out of all his troubles.    <br>
The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him,  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>and he delivers them.    <br>
    <br>
Taste and see that the Lord is good;  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>blessed is the one who takes refuge in him.    <br>
Fear the Lord, you his holy people,  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>for those who fear him lack nothing.    <br>
The lions may grow weak and hungry,  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.    <br>
Come, my children, listen to me;  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>I will teach you the fear of the Lord.    <br>
Whoever of you loves life  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>and desires to see many good days,    <br>
keep your tongue from evil  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>and your lips from telling lies.    <br>
Turn from evil and do good;  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>seek peace and pursue it.    <br>
    <br>
The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>and his ears are attentive to their cry;    <br>
but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil,  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>to blot out their name from the earth.    <br>
    <br>
The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them;  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>he delivers them from all their troubles.    <br>
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>and saves those who are crushed in spirit.    <br>
    <br>
The righteous person may have many troubles,  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>but the Lord delivers him from them all;    <br>
he protects all his bones,  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>not one of them will be broken.    <br>
    <br>
Evil will slay the wicked;  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>the foes of the righteous will be condemned.    <br>
The Lord will rescue his servants;  <br>
<div class="tab"></div>no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.    <br>
<br>

<h4>Colossians 3:1-3 & 12-17</h4>
</div>
<div class="justif">

Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.  <br>
<br>  
<div class="text-center">*<div class=tab></div>*<div class=tab></div>*</div>
<br>  

Therefore, as Godâ€™s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. <br>
<br>
Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.  <br>

<h3>SONG</h3>

<h4>Psalm 150 (Praise The Lord)</h4>
</div>
<div class="song">

You made the starry hosts  <br>
You traced the mountain peaks  <br>
You paint the evening sky with wonders  <br>
The earth, it is Your throne  <br>
From desert to the sea  <br>
All nature testifies Your splendour  <br>
  <br>
  <i>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord  <br>
Sing His greatness all creation  <br>
Praise the Lord, raise your voice  <br>
You heights and all you depths  <br>
From furthest east to west  <br>
Let everything that has breath  <br>
Praise the Lord  <br>
</i>
  <br>
You reached into the dust  <br>
In love, Your Spirit breathed  <br>
You formed us in Your very likeness  <br>
To know Your wondrous works  <br>
To tell Your mighty deeds  <br>
To join the everlasting chorus  <br>
  <br>
  <i>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord  <br>
Sing His greatness all creation  <br>
Praise the Lord, raise your voice  <br>
You heights and all you depths  <br>
From furthest east to west  <br>
Let everything that has breath  <br>
Praise the Lord  <br>
</i>
  <br>
Let symphonies resound  <br>
Let drums and choirs ring out  <br>
All heaven hear the sound of worship  <br>
Let every nation bring  <br>
Its honours to the King  <br>
A roar of harmonies eternal  <br>
  <br>
<i>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord  <br>
Sing His greatness all creation  <br>
Praise the Lord, raise your voice  <br>
You heights and all you depths  <br>
From furthest east to west  <br>
You distant burning stars  <br>
All creatures, near and far  <br>
From sky to sea to shore  <br>
Sing out forevermore  <br>
Let everything that has breath  <br>
Praise the Lord  <br>
